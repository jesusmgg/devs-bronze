Automatically setups workspaces.

Requires my specific hardware and software setup so may not be that useful to anybody else.

# Usage
```bash
$ ./devs.sh project_name 4 # Setups up workspace 4 with project `project_name`
$ ./devs.sh 4              # Setups up workspace 4 and opens a prompt to select project
```
